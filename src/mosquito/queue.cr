module Mosquito
  # A named Queue.
  #
  # Named Queues exist in Redis and have 4 ordered lists: waiting, pending, scheduled, and dead.
  #
  # - The Waiting list is for jobs which need to be executed as soon as possible.
  # - The Pending list is for jobs which are currently being executed.
  # - The Scheduled list is indexed by execution time and holds jobs which need to be executed at a later time.
  # - The Dead list is for jobs which have been retried too many times and are no longer viable.
  #
  # A task is represented in a queue by its id.
  #
  # A task flows through the queues in this manner:
  #
  #
  # ```text
  #  Time=0: Task does not exist yet, lists are empty
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled    Dead
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=1: Task is enqueued
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled    Dead
  #     Task#1
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=2: Task begins running. Task is moved to pending and executed
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled    Dead
  #              Task#1
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=3: Tasks are Enqueued.
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled    Dead
  #     Task#2   Task#1
  #     Task#3
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=4: Task succeeds, next task begins.
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled    Dead
  #     Task#3   Task#2
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=5: Task fails and is scheduled for later, next task begins.
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled     Dead
  #              Task#3  t=7:Task#2
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=6: Task succeeds. Nothing is executing.
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled     Dead
  #                      t=7:Task#2
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=7: Scheduled task is due and is moved to waiting. Nothing is executing.
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled     Dead
  #     Task#2
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=8: Task begins executing (for the second time).
  #
  #    Waiting  Pending  Scheduled     Dead
  #              Task#2
  #
  #  ---------------------------------
  #  Time=9: Task finished successfully. No more tasks present.
