module Mosquito
  # This singleton class serves as a shorthand for starting and managing an Overseer.
  #
  # A minimal usage of Mosquito::Runner is:
  #
  # ```
  # require "mosquito"
  #
  # # When the process receives sigint, it'll notify the overseer to shut down gracefully.
  # trap("INT") do
  #   Mosquito::Runner.stop(wait: true)
  # end
  #
  # # Starts the overseer, and holds the thread captive.
  # Mosquito::Runner.start
  # ```
  #
  # If for some reason you want to manage an overseer or group of overseers yourself, Mosquito::Runner can be omitted entirely:
  #
  # ```crystal
  # require "mosquito"
  #
  # mosquito = Mosquito::Overseer.new
  #
  # # Spawns a mosquito managed fiber and returns immediately
  # mosquito.run
  #
  # trap "INT" do
  #   mosquito.stop.receive
  # end
  # ```
  class Runner
    Log = ::Log.for self

    # Start the mosquito runner.
    #
    # If spin = true (default) the function will not return until the runner is
    # shut down.  Otherwise it will return immediately.
    #
    def self.start(spin = true)
      Log.notice { "Mosquito is buzzing..." }
      instance.run

      while spin && keep_running
        sleep 1
