module Mosquito
  # Runnable implements a general purpose spawn/loop which carries a state
  # enum.
  #
  # ## Managing a Runnable
  #
  # The primary purpose of Runnable is to cleanly abstract the details of
  # spawning a thread, running a loop, and shutting down when asked.
  #
  # A service which manages a Runnable might look like this:
  #
  # ```crystal
  # runnable = MyRunnable.new
  #
  # # This will spawn and return immediately.
  # runnable.start
  #
  # puts runnable.state # => State::Working
  #
  # # Some time later...
  # should_be_stopped = runnable.stop has_stopped =
  # should_be_stopped.receive
  # ```
  #
  #
  # ## Implementing a Runnable
  #
  # A runnable implementation needs to implement only two methods: #each_run
  # and #runnable_name. In addition, pre_run and post_run are available for
  # setup and teardown.
  #
  # Runnable state is managed automatically through startup and shutdown, but
  # within each_run it can be manually altered with `#state=`.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # ```crystal
  # class MyRunnable
  #   include Mosquito::Runnable
  #
  #   # Optional
  #   def pre_run
  #     puts "my runnable is starting"
  #   end
  #
  #   def each_run
  #     puts "my runnable is running"
  #   end
  #
  #   # Optional
  #   def post_run
  #     puts "my runnable has stopped"
  #   end
  #
  #   def runnable_name
  #     "MyRunnable"
  #   end
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Implementation details about what work should be done in the spawned fiber
  # are placed in #each_run.
