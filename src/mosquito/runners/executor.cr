  # The executor is the center of work in Mosquito, and it's is the demarcation
  # point between Mosquito framework and application code. Above the Executor
  # is entirely Mosquito, and below it is application code.
  #
  # An Executor is responsible for hydrating Job classes with deserialized
  # parameters and calling `Mosquito::Job#run` on them. It measures the time it
  # takes to run a job and provides detailed log messages about the current
  # status.
  #
  # An executor is a `Mosquito::Runnable` and should be interacted with according to
  # the Runnable API.
  #
  # To build an executor, provide a job input channel and an idle bell channel. These
  # channels can be shared between all available executors.
  #
  # The executor will ring the idle bell when it is ready to accept work and then wait
  # for work to show up on the job pipeline. After the job is finished it will ring the
  # bell again and wait for more work.
