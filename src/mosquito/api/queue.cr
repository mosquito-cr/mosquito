    # # => {"waiting" => 0, "scheduled" => 0, "pending" => 0, "dead" => 0}
    # ```
    #
    # The semantics of the keys are described in detail on the `Mosquito::Queue` class, but in brief:
    #
    # - `scheduled` is a list of jobs which are scheduled to be executed at a later time.
    # - `waiting` is a list of jobs which should be executed ASAP
    # - `pending` is a list of jobs for which execution has started
    # - `dead` is a list of jobs which have failed to execute
